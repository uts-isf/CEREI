**RECRNTAzero** is an open-source Java desktop application designed to model the energy market using network and retailer tariffs, including associated losses.

RECRNTAzero presents a number of novelties and advantages:
- To help industrial and commercial customers to reduce their energy costs and improve their environmental performance.
- To help decision-makers within the industrial and commercial organisations to identify cost-effective renewable energy solutions.
- To support the integration of renewable energy sources into existing power systems, and to facilitate the transition to a more sustainable energy system.
